# Potters Ipsum

Potters Ipsum is a placeholder text generator similar to lorem ipsum, except it generates text in an unusual English dialect from North Staffordshire, as documented in the "Jabez" stories by A. Scott (real name Wilfred Bloor) published in the 1960s and 70s. The text is generated by selecting random sentences from a collection of stories called "The Second Book of Jabez", which was self-published in 1973. The stories are based on true events that occurred during the early 19th and late 18th century in and around the hamlet of Scot Hay. You can find the original sources and other works of Wilfred Bloor in the links below.

Users can select how many paragraphs to generate, and the minimum and maximum number of sentences in each paragraph (for each paragraph the target number of sentences is a random number inbetween).  There is also a "Copy to clipboard" button, and a "Regenerate" button to force a new output of text without adjusting the parameters.

To make your own Lorum Ipsum this code can be easily customized.  Just fork the repo and replace the content in `src/components/generateText/jabez.js` with anything you like.  

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
