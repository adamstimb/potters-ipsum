const jabez = `Ey was nice a lad but ar dunna think ey'd in the country afoer.
Th'fost dee when ey come ite fer plee with us wey tuk 'im dine th'feylds.
That lad's mother shoulda 'ad moer sense than turn 'im ite in a good suit an' a pair o' fancy shoes.
It inna exactly th'sort o' thing fer wear when thee't climbin' treys an' messin' abite dine th'feylds.
We 'adna gone very fer afoer ey slipped on a fresh-done cow-flop an' finished up on 'is backside.
That didna do 'is trysers any good fer a start.
Wey scraped some on it off with a peyce o' stick an' then weyped 'im dine with 'andfuls o' gress.
Ey didna seym fer bey aw that gain on 'is feyt - p'raps it was with beyin' used ter walkin' on th'level dine London.
Be th'tarme wey'd climbed a trey or two an' pleed in th'bruk an' rind th'basselows that suit ey'd gotten on was ready fer th'rag-mon, an 'is fancy shoes were wet through an' laubed up with clee.
Th'lad's mother got on to us when 'er seyd 'im.
'Er said wey'd done it on purpose, but wey 'adna.
Th'lad 'ad just tried fer do wot wey did an' ey wonna very good at it.
Ey were frittened death o' animals o' aw sorts.
Thee couldstna get 'im  anywheer near a steeble, or a pigstee, or a feyld o' cows.
An' th'poer lad were a bit tickle-stomached ower smells.
Ar remember wey tuk 'im in th'farmyard one dee fer show 'im rind.
Th'farmer 'appened fer bey cartin' muck at th'tarme an' this lad started coughin' an' 'eavin - ar thowght ey were goin' bey sick on th'spot.
It gets a bit owerpowerin' when its forked up, dunna it?
Mind thee, ar reckon it's a good 'ealthy smell fer aw that.
But 'ey fergot aw abite th'smell when th'owd gander put 'is neck ite an' come fer 'im.
Ey sqeuyled larke a stuck pig an' ran off dine th'village ter 'is mother.
But ar nowticed as when theyse lads funt ite wot a lot o' pocket-money ey'd gotten thee aw gethered rind fer 'elp 'im spend it!
This lad 'ad a funny road o' talkin' - wey couldna understand 'im at fost.
Mind thee, it wonna is fawt - aw them London folk talk bit funny, dunna thee?
Are remember tellin' 'im wey didna put 'batter' on us bread up this road - wey meede pon-cakes ite on it!
After a few wiks, wey'd larned 'im a thing or two an' ey was beginnin' fer luk a bit larke a village lad.
Wot dust think ey said to us when it were tarme fer 'im got back London?
Ey said: 'Ar'll come an' sey yer aggen as soon as ar con!'
So, thee seyst, wey'd larned 'im fer talk reyght an' aw.
Mind thee, th'lad's mother didna think so when 'er 'eerd 'im!
Ar remember takkin' a message fer a woman wot was a bit of skin-flint.
'Er said 'er'd pee me when are got back.
Ar was ony a bit of a lad an' it was gettin' on fer threy miles theer an' back.
On th'road wom ar was wonderin' if 'er'd give me a penny or twopence, an' are was plannin' wot ar'd buy with it.
In me mind's eye ar spent that money ower an' ower aggen.
Anyroad, when are got back 'er said: 'Ar'll give thee summat next tarme ar sey thee - ar anna got any cheenge.'
For prove it 'er tuk a ten-bob note ite o' 'er poss an' 'eld it up.
But ar'd 'eerd th'chink o' oney when 'er oppened th'poss.
Ar thowght: 'Jabez lad, 'er's coddin' thee.  'Er's fer doin' thee ite o' thee money.'
So ar said: 'That's awreyght, ar'll get it cheenged fer yer,' an' ar snatched th'note ite o' 'er and an' went beltin' fer th'shop.
Ar towd th'shop-woman ar didna want any coppers in th'cheenge - just silver.
Ar thowght ter messel' 'er'll 'ave give me a tanner nar, an' it sarves 'er reyght fer tryin' diddle me.
But bless mey, when ar tuk th'cheenge back 'er said: 'Wost dust think Jabez?  Ar've funt a penny lyin' abite wot ar didna know ar'd gotten.'
Ar reckon them folks wot cawed 'er a skin-flint wonner fer ite.
Talkin' abite sendin' messages, thee wouldstna remember Pollymary wouldst?
'Er 'ad a sister wot lived in a little cottage in th'bottom o' th'valley.
Gettin' on fer 'afe a mile awee it was.
Pollymary used shyte messages to 'er.
It dunna seym possible does it?
But 'er 'ad a reyght good pair o' lungs an' 'er voice travlled well dine that valley.
'Er used come ter th'top o' th'bonk an' cup 'er 'ands rind 'er mythe an' shyte 'Coo-ee. Coo-ee.'
Just nar 'er sister 'ud come ter th'doer an' thee'd bey shytin' ter one another fer many a wheyle.
But wey pleed a trick on 'er one dee.
Ther were two on us pleein' in th'gorse-bushes 'afe-wee dine th'feylds when Pollymary come fer 'ave a shyte ter 'er sister.
Th'sister's 'usband musta bin poerly, 'cos Pollymary shyted: 'Is Billy any better?'
Wey got behin th'bushes an' imitated th'sister's voice an shyted up: 'Billy's jed.'
Wey didna think 'er'd bey takken in as easy as that, but 'er was.
'Er come runnin' dine th'feylds an' wey expected 'er go neck an' crop any minute.
'Er 'ad fer 'ave a bacca at th'second stile - th'owd lass was blowin' larke brokken-winded 'oss.
Wey didna stop fer find ite wot 'appened when 'er got ter 'er sisters.
Pollymary was a big woman - 'er coulda picked both on us up be th'scruff o' th'neck an' banged us yeds 'gether.
Mind thee, ar think wey desarved it, dustna they?
At comin' in?
Ee, that brought back some memories.
'Er used live in th'village as a child but 'er lives off Leyk road nar.
It's a good many yeers since ar seyd 'er.
Wey were just talkin' abite some o' th'things wey did an' some o' th'owd folk we could remember.
Ar used plee with 'er a lot afoer wey were owd enough go schoo'.
'Er was as pretty as a picture an' 'er could twist me rind 'er little finger.
One o' me earliest memories was beyin' with 'er in a feyld at th'back o' their 'ice.
Wey couldna 'ave bin moer than threy or foer yeer owd.
'Er beleyved in fairies an' 'er towd me as theyse fairies popped ite o' flowers when thee opened ther petals.
Wey sat wetchin' some buttercups an' deesies for many a wheyle but ar never seyd any fairies - 'er said it was because ar didna beleyve in 'em!
It's funny wot little things stick in thee mind, inna it?
Ar reminded 'er abite th'tarme when 'er used send me inter th'middins.
Them folks wot lived in th'terrace 'ises didna 'ave dust-bins in them dees - thee 'ad big brick middins fer put ther esses an' rubbish in.
This lass used send me ferritin' abite in theyse middins fer find peyces o' brokken pleetes an' owd socepans an' things so's 'er could plee 'ises with 'em.
Th'teeble 'ud bey an erring-box with a peyce o' owd wo'-peeper on it fer a teeble-cloth.
Th'dresser was another box, or a pile o' bricks, with a jamjar full o' weyld flowers on it, an' ther'd bey an owd bag on th'floer fer a carpet.
Ar was supposed fer bey th'usband an' ar 'ad fer eat aw sorts o' stuff off theyse brokken pleetes - raw taters an' chonnucks, aw sorts o' berries, 'awthorn buds fer cheyse, vetch pods fer peys, an' them little read an' yeller flowers wot wey cawed eggs an' beecon.
Ar 'ad fer wesh it dine with cowd weyter ite o' an owd cracked cup from th'middin.
It's a wonder ar didna 'ave bally-ache or woss!
Er was tellin' me it was mey wot larned 'er fer swing a canful o' milk withite spillin' any.
Wey used fetch th'milk from th'farm in a can with a weyer 'andle an' a lid.
When thee gotst th'knack on it thee couldst tak th'lid off an' swing th'can rind an' rind thee yed withite any comin' ite.
Mind thee, it was best fer practice with weyter afoer thee triedst it with a quart o' milk!
As this lass got owder 'er turned inter a reyght tum-boy.
When th'other wenches were pleein' 'opscotch or pleein' with ther dolls, 'er'd bey pleein' bodger or rinkers with us lads, or climbin' treys or gettin' inter some mischief on 'er own somewheer.
Fer luk at 'er nar thee wouldstna think as th'farmer once 'ad fer fish 'er ite o' th'pig-swill barrel.
'Er'd bin missin rind th'farm an' decided fer feyd th'pigs.
Th'trouble was th'barrel was neyly empty an' when 'er leyned ower th'side fer ladle some ite 'er owerbalanced an' fell in!
'Er musta stunk summat terrible 'cos th'farmer 'ad fer pour buckets o' weyter ower 'er afoer ey dost let 'er go wom.
'Er mother used despair on 'er at tarmes.
Ar remember takkin' 'er wom one dee when 'er'd gashed 'er leg open on some barbed weyer.
Ar towd 'er mother 'er'd lost a lot o' blood but dust know wot 'er mother said?
'Er said: 'It'll do 'er good! 'Er could do with some o' that mad blood lettin' ite on 'er.
But 'er was a grand lass fer aw that.
Ar reckon that bloke wot wrote that hymn 'O day of rest an' gladness' adna 'eerd abite theyse local preychers trampin' up an' dine th'country, it wonna exactly a rest-dee for them.
Tak owd Daniel fer instance.
Ey musta preyched fer nigh on 50 yeer.
Ar con remember one Sundee mornin' when ey eksed me if ar'd larke go with 'im ter a little chapel off Crewe road.
Ar'd bey in me early twenties at th'tarme.
Wey'd just come ite o' Sundee Schoo' an' ey was goin' tak th'Harvest Festival services at this chapel.
It was a nice dee at th'back-end o' September so ar said: 'Awreyght, ar'll go with thee fer company. Wot tarms are we startin' off?'
Ey said wey were goin' nar - straight awee.
Ey reckoned it'd tak us th'best part o two 'ours fer get theer, an' ey'd bin invited ter a farm-'ice fer 'is dinner an' tey.
So we struck off.
Ar soon funt ite as owd Daniel 'adna much use fer roads an' paths unless thee 'appened fer bey on th'crowline.
If thee wonna, ey just cut straight across th'feylds.
It 'ad bin a leete harvest an' there were a lot o' corn still weetin' fer bey carted.
Owd Daniel lukked at it an'said: 'There's one hymn wey shanna bey 'avin' terdee.
Wey conna sing 'All is safely gathered in' withite tellin' lies, con we?
Wey got ter this farm abite one o'clock.
Ar've never seyn ser much stuff on a dinner-teeble eether befoer or since.
Ther was enough fer feyd an army!
Ar was that famished ar 'ad me kneyfe an' foke at th'ready afoer owd Daniel 'ad finished th'grace.
Ar didna 'ear much o' 'is sermon in th'afternoon - ar was full ter bostin' an' ar think ar musta dozed off.
Th'farmer's weyfe thowght ther was summat up with me.
Owd Daniel did it justice though, an' ey give 'em a good threy-quarters of an 'our sermon at neyght.
Dust know, ar con still remember 'is text — it was ite o' the' Owd Testament: 'Thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy fields, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest — thou shalt leave them for the poor and the stranger.'
Th'farmer would 'ave us goin' back ter th'farm fer some supper.
Theyse farmers dunna 'afe get through some snappin'!
Wey 'ad cheyse, pittled damsons an' wom-beeked bread.
It was dark be this tarme an' wey'd got a couple o' 'ours walkin' fer do.
Anyroad, th'farmer said ey'd get th'pony an' trap ite fer tak us dine th'leene as fer as th'meen road.
Ar thowght th'farmer 'ud bey comin' with us, but ey said: 'When 'ee get ter th'meen road just turn th'pony rind an' start 'im back wom - ey'll bey awreyght.'
Wey stood an' listened fer a bit ter th'pony trottin' back up th'leene an' then owd Daniel struck off across th'feylds aggen.
Th'owd feller 'ad got bey up at 5 o'clock in th'mornin' fer go dine th'pit.
Ar reckon somebody ought ter 'ave given 'im a medal.
Come fer think on it though, p'raps SOMEBODY did!
Ther were little pits an' tunnels aw ower the'opper.
Did ar ever tell thee abite them two brothers wot dug a tunnel inter th'side o' a bonk?
Th'seym o' coal wonna much moer than a foot thick, but it was a bit o' good stuff.
Theyse brothers 'ad a box on some runners with a peyce o' rope tied ter eych end.
One on 'em 'ud crawl inter th'ole with a candle, draggin' th'box after 'im.
When ey'd filled th'box with coal, ey'd give a couple o' tugs on th'rope.
Th'other brother pulled th'box ite an' emptied it, an' then signalled fer it bey pulled back aggen.
But one dee when ey pulled th'box ite ther wonna any coal in it — ther was a bird's neyst in it with foer eggs!
Ey stood theer scrattin' 'is yed an' gawpin' at this neyst.
Ey couldna understand it but ey shyted dine th'ole: 'Dust want 'em fried or poached?'
Wot dust think 'ad 'appened, sirree?
This tunnel 'ad gone straight through th'bonk an' come ite on th'other side oa a bush!
This nest was in th'bush.
So, fer a laugh, ey'd popped it in th'box an' signalled 'is brother fer pull it ite.
Tote th'end o' th'strike, aw theyse little pits 'ad fer bey filled in.
Ther was a mon comin' fer inspect 'em at 12 o'clock on th'Satdee.
Mind thee, a lot on 'em were drawin' coal 'till th'last minute.
Two on 'em 'ad a shaft abite 20 foot deyp an' thee left it too leete fer fill th'ole in.
So thee put some branches across top o' th'ole an' covered em with clods an' threw a bit o' dirt on top.
This inspector-mon were bit suspicious abite this big pile o' dirt wot thee 'adna put back.
When ey eksed 'em abite it one o' th'owd miners said: 'Dunna worry theesel' abite that lad. It's just a bit wot wey 'ad left ower. Mey an' Charlie are goin' dig another 'ole fer put it in.'
When theedst gotten a couple o' two-gallon buckets o' couldst manage.
Mind thee, ar awwees reckoned as two buckets on a 'oop were better than maulin' with 'em one at a tarme — thee wast moer balanced, larke.
But it didna 'afe give thee fingers wot fer on a cowd winter's mornin'!
Ther was neyly awwees a bit o' 'oss-plee goin' on dine th'wood-well.
One o' th'tricks thee used plee on thee was fer lee 'owd o' one o' th'buckets o' weyter an' pull thee rind an' rind withit.
Ther was nowt much thee couldst do abite it 'cept go rind larke a top inside th'oop.
Theyse two buckets welly pulled thee arms ite o' ther sockets.
Dust know wot it used put me in mind on? - them steym guvnor things wot thee 'ad on th'weyndin' injin at th'pit.
If thee putst thee buckets dine afoer theetst stopped spinnin' aw th' weyter tipped ite, an' then thee 'adst go aw th'wee back ter th'well fer some moer.
After a spell o' drey weather th'weyter ony dribbled ite o' this spring an' it used tak many a wheyle fer fill a bucket.
Them as 'ad proper wells were best off.
Most on 'em were in gardins, but ar remember two wot were inside th'ice — under th'scullery floer.
Ther was a knack, thee knowst, ter gettin' weyter ite o' theyse wells.
Thee 'adst fer drop thee bucket in gentle so's thee didstna churn up th'muck at th'bottom.
Then thee givst th'rope a flick so's th'bucket tipped ower on its side.
Some o' theyse wells were a good depth, an' thee wonna cleyned aw that offen.
Theydst bey surprised at some o' th' things wot were funt dine 'em.
Owd 'ats an' shoes, clee-pipes an' tins o' bacca, wetches, lumps o' scrap-iron, an' nar an' aggen a bit o' money.
Course ther were awwees a bucket or two at th'bottom, an' a two-three lenths o' owd rope.
Ar remember seyin' an owd wooden bucket wot 'ad come ite o' a well.
It musta bin dine fer donkey's yeers but it 'ud still 'owd weyter.
Ther was offen a frog or two swimmin' arind, but ar think lads musta put 'em in 'cos folks were very perticler abite coverin' th'well up.
In them dees, cleyn weyter was only used fer drinkin' an' cookin' an' such-larke.
Thee used reen-weyter or pond-weyter fer most everythin' else.
Ar'll tell thee wot sirree, nar weyn aw gotten taps in th'ice ar never grumble abite peein' me weyter rate.
Tt's a wonder ter mey as some o' them colliers didna 'ave ther 'ises burnt dine with aw them close rind th'fire.
Mind thee, one or two on 'em neyly managed it.
Ar remember one on 'em tellin' me abite th'tarme when 'is missus wok up in th'middle o' th'neyght an' said: 'Weeke up Tum ar can smell burnin'.'
Ey towd 'er get of sleyp with 'er, but 'er wouldna rest
Er werritted that much ey 'ad fer get up.
When ey oppened th'stair-foot doer th'kitchen was full o' smoke!
Ey shyted: 'Nell! Theyst better come dine - me trysers are on fire.'
Er said: 'Oh my lors, Costna dite 'em?'
Tum shyted back: 'Ar've dited em but ar shanna bey eeble go work in 'em — thers oles in th'legs big enough get thee yed through.'
When 'er come dine 'er said ey 'adna got an moer fer go in.
Ther was ony 'is best blue an' 'is flannels, an' 'er wonner lettin' 'im go in them.
So 'er funt a peyce o' cloth ite 'o th'rag-bag an' petched 'em fer 'im.
Then 'er said: 'Them'll 'ave do. Ar conna sey wot ar'm doin' withite me glasses an' ar'm blessed if ar con think wheer ar've put 'em. Theyt 'ave manage with 'em 'till ar con get thee a' pair o' mowl-skins ite o' th'maxim.'
So thee went back bed an' th'next thing 'er remembered was Tum shytin': 'Nell! Come dine quick. Ar'm in a reyght' mess — ar've lost th'use o' me leg!'
'Er said: 'Theyst wot? Wotever's up with thee nar?'
So ey shyted back. 'Well, eether ar'm paralysed from the weest dine or else theyst meede'a reyght owd cobble' o' theyse trysers. Ar conna move.'
Dust know wot 'er'd done, sirree?
Some road or other er'd stitched th'legs 'gether betweyn th'kneys.
'Ee!' ey said.  'They 'adst me worried fer a bit. Next tarme thee mendest me trysers in th'middle o' th'neyght meeke sure fer put 'thee specs on. Ar was beginnin' fer think theydst 'ave push me work in th'wheyl-barrer.'
Ar reckon every dog 'as its dee.
At one tarme th'corn were awwees cut wi' a sickle or a scythe.
Then th'reypin' macheynes come, an' then th'beynders, an' nar this greet lummockin' contraption.
Thee cost 'ardly credit as when th'childer livin' nar get owd thee'll luk back an' tell their childer wot a grand seyght it was fer wetch this greet thing go through a feyld spewin' ite corn an' straw.
Ar wonder wot some o' th'owd uns 'ud think abite it?
In them dees, two acres o' wuts was a good dee's work fer a mon wi' a scythe.
An' then it 'ad fer bey put up in sheyves an' stooked.
Th'owd folks used reckon fer leyve th'stooks standin' on th'stubble 'till it 'ad 'eerd th'church bells ring on threy Sundees.
Then it 'ad fer bey carted an' stacked fer weet fer th'thresher come rind.
Ar'll tell thee wot though, ar used enjoy beyin' in th'arvest feyld in th'owd dees.
Mind thee, it was 'ard work an' th'dees were lung an' th'pee were poer.
But some-road or other folks seymed fer bey moer contented.
Ar'm aw in favour o' takkin' th'ard work ite o' a job providin' a mon con get some satisfaction ite o' doin' wot's left.
As ar luk at it, a mon's got fer bey comfortable with 'imsel', if thee gets me meynin'.
An' if ey dunna get some satisfaction ite o' 'is job it's as sure as God meede little apple thers trouble brewin' fer somebody somewheer. 
Theyt sey folks at th'arvest festival wot thee wutna sey at any other service bar a buryin' or a marryin'.
It inna aw that lung ago since a good 'arvest meant th' difference betweyn a full bally an' a empty 'un in th'winter.
Thers bin a two-three cheenges since then but a mon still conna do withite 'is snappin'.
Wey con do some clever things but ar anna 'eerd tell abite a mon meekin' a bleede o' gress yet, let alone a grain o' corn.
Ar reckon that's th'top an' bottom on it.
Ar used larke sey a lad tackle a good peyce.
Them peyces were as thick as doer-steps.
It was now use 'eksin' 'im fer seeve thee th'crusses though - ey eat them fost. 
An' th'sparrers didna get very fat on th'crumbs eether.
Ar think ar towd thee as when ar was a bit of a lad ar used go rind with th'butcher-mon in 'is pony an' trap.
Ther was one thing wot puzzled me fer a lung tarme — th'poerest family in th'village 'ad th'biggest parcel o' meyt.
Dust know wot it was, sirree? A greet big lump o' udder, an' thee 'ad it neyly every wik-end.
Ar didna fancy it mesel' but ar reckon it was eether that or nothin' fer th'poer souls.
Another thing that family used 'ave a lot on was breadpuddin'.
Ther musta bin seven or eight childer at th'tarme ar'm speykin' abite. 
Ar could never keyp kynt o' them childer — ther awwees seymed fer bey another un since th'last kynt.
Anyroad, 'er used meeke this puddin' in a big jowl.
Ar 'ad many a lot on it.
Ar used plee with some o' theyse childer an' when thee were 'avin' bread-puddin' fer ther dinners thee'd eks me fer 'ave some.
Ther was nowbody could meeke bread-puddin' larke that woman.
Th'top on it 'ud bey neyce an' crisp with some bryn sugar on it.
'Er put aw sorts o' things in it - a bit o' rhubub or a two-three goose-gogs, or some wind-blown apples, or black-berries, or owt wot was in seyson.
When 'er 'adna got owt else, 'er'd put some currans or reesons in, but when thee funst one thee 'adst fer shyte 'oo-ray 'cos ther'd ony bey a 'andful on 'em in that big jowl.
One o' th'little lads used put me off a bit though: Ey awwees seymed fer 'ave a couple o' candles runnin' dine 'is nose on ter 'is puddin'.
Mind thee, th'little chap couldna 'elp it, ey 'ad one o' them everlastin' cowds in th'yed.
Ey'd never 'ad a proper 'enkerchief an' 'is gansy-sleyve were a bit rough on is little nose.
But it was rattlin' good breadpuddin'.
That's a geeme wot's stood th'test o' tarme.
Wey used scrat a cirtle on th'grind abite foer foot across, an' us lads 'ud put a scoer' or moer taws in it apeyce.
Ther'd bey threy or foer 'undred awgether in this cirtle.
Then wey'd draw a mark abite 30 yards awee, an' slat this iron pitcher at th'taws in us turn.
Th'idea was fer drop it just in front o' th'cirtle so's it skidded inter theyse taws an' knocked 'em ite.
They couldst 'ave aw them wot went iteside th'cirtle.
Mind thee, a lot on 'em got brok, 'specially if thee 'appenst fer ower- pitch it an' drop reyght on top on 'em.
It peed thee fer stand well back when somebody else was pitchin' — some on 'em slat a bit weyld an' that theer iron pitcher coulda takken thee yed off thee showders.
Ar've offen wondered if peggy wonna th' meekin' o' some o' th'good cricketers weyn 'ad in th'village.
An ar'll tell thee another geeme wot thee dustna sey pleed nar-a-rees — bodger!
Ee! Ar've welly brok me back a tarme or two pleein' bodger.
Foer lads on each seyd were abite th'best number, with th'fattest 'un fer th'bally-bunter.
Th'bally-bunter stood with 'is back ter a wo' an' one o' th'lads bent dine with is yed in this bally-bunter's bally.
Then th'other two bent dine an' cushioned ther yeds in th'backside o' th'lad in front on 'em.
When thee'd aw gotten dine th'other foer lads wot were goin' fogger 'ad fer on ter theyse threy lads' backs.
Th'fost lad wot jumped 'ad fer try an' clear th'fost two backs an'land on th'third un.
If ey didna it meant as ther was ony one back left fer aw th'other threy lads fer jump on to.
It was now joke 'avin' threy 'efty lads on thee back, an' aw on 'em fangin' 'owd on thee some-wheer so's thee wouldna fo' off.
Thee 'ad fer stee theer withite touchin' th'grind 'till one on 'em 'ad kynted two, foer, six, eight, ten, bodger!
Ar'll tell thee wot sirree, some o'th'lads weyn gotten nar-a-dees wouldna get inter ser much trouble if thee 'ad some o' th' stuffin' knocked ite on 'em with a two-three geemes o' peggy or bodger.
Ar'll 'ave a luk at it nar an' aggen but ar dunna reckon ar con do it much 'arm.
Bring us a stick o' rock back or a monkey up a stick.
Ee! Anna thee neyce? Dust know wot thee remind me on, sirree? 
Them owd magic-lantern shows wot wey used 'ave.
Ther was a mon wot used give theyse lantern-lectures on a wik-neyght in th'Sundee Schoo'.
Ey 'ad a greet big lantern — aw brass an' meeogony.
'It run. off that theer 'cetylene gas — thee knowst, that stuff wot wey used 'ave in us bike lamps.
Ony this mon.'ad a big gasometer thing wot stood on th'floer.
Ar dunna reyghtly know wot sort o' contraption it was but ey used fil it with weyter an' put theyse big lumps o' carbide inseyd it.
It didna 'afe stink!
When ey'd lit th'burners in this lantern ey fastened a wheyte sheyt up on th'wo'. 
Ey 'ad some sleydes with hymns on 'em an' wey'd 'ave a good sing fer start off with.
Then ey'd put two or threy funny sleydes on fer us childer.
Ar con remember one on 'em — it was an owd mon in bed with 'is mythe weyd oppen.
Just nar ther come a mouse from under th'bed an' ran up th'bedclose an' across th'bed an' dine this owd mon's throat.
Theyse meyce kept comin' from under th'bed — dozens on 'em — an' thee aw went inter 'is mythe.
It was th'fost movin' picture a lot on us 'ad ever seyn an' wey thowght it was marvellous.
After wey'd 'ad th'funny uns ey showedpictures o' foreign parts an' talked abite 'em.
Thee were mostly abite missionaries.
Sometarmes ey showed pictures abite th'eyils o' strong drink an ey'd 'ave us singin': "Dare to be a Daniel, dare to stand alone, dare to pass the public-house and take your money home.”
Some. o' th'owder lads wot sat at th'back pleed tricks on this mon. 
Ther was a rubber peype wot went from this gasometer ter th'lantern an' theyse lads used put ther feyt on it an' squeyze it.
Th'leyght 'ud start goin' ite an' th'mon 'ad keyp turnin' th'gas up.
Just when ey'd got it reyght theyse' lads lifted ther feyt off th'peyp an' th'flame shot up reyght through th'top o' th'owd lantern. 
It's a wonder ey didna set th'place afire.
One neyght th'leyght went ite awgether, an' then ther was an awmighty bang.
Panic set in, an' th'folks started meekin' fer th'doer an' foin' ower one another.
Th'pleece was as dark as a bag 'cos aw th'paraffin lamps 'ad bin turned ite.
Anyroad up, somebody 'ad 'th'nowce fer kindle one o' theyse lamps an' thee funt this lantern-mon lukkin' larke a drynded rat.
Aw th'weyter 'ad bin blown ite o' 'is gasworks an', be th' luk on 'im, most on it ad 'gone aw ower 'im.
Ar dunna know whether them lads at th'back 'ad owt do with it but it was a long wheyle afoer ey come aggen.'.
Thee wouldstna remember me cousin Amos, wouldst?
Ey lives at Congerton nar.
Ey was ower this road awheyle back an' wey 'ad a reyght good natter abite th'owd dees.
Ey lived next doer ey was a lad.
Me granmother on me feyther's side lived with us at that tarme.
'Er was a bit of a strait-laced un was me granmother an' 'er an' Amos didna 'it it off aw that well.
'Er reckoned ey'd bin spoilt in th'rearin', but ar dunna think ey was that bad.
But ey was one o' them lads wot couldna keyp 'is fingers ite o' things, 'specially things wot'd gotten 'oles in 'em.
An' it wonna ony 'is fingers eether.
If ey seyd a 'ole ey 'ad fer put 'is finger in it, or 'is arm, or 'is yed if it were a big 'ole. 
Got 'is finger fast in a knot-'ole in th'closet doer awmost afoer ey could walk, an' th'fost dee at schoo' ey got 'is 'and stuck dine a grid in th'plee-grind.
It seymed as if ey couldna resist 'oles.
Funny thing, wonna it?
Ey used get fast in aw sorts o'things, an' ey 'ad many a good thrashin' fer it.
Most tarmes thee were able fer get 'im unstuck, but tweyce thee 'ad fer tak 'im up th'Infirmry — once on 'accynt o' 'im 'avin' 'is finger stuck up a peyce o' iron-pipin', an' once with 'is 'and in an owd stone pittle-jar.
'Is mother was fer takkin' 'im ter th'blacksmith fer 'ave this iron-pipin' sawed off 'is finger but Amos wonna 'avin' any. 
Ey could remember goin' theer once befoer fer 'ave a soce-pan tu off 'is yed.
Ey'd got this soce-pan fast when ey was pleein' sowjers in it dine th'feylds.
Somebody 'appened 'it 'im top o' th'yed an' it stuck fast.
When thee tuk 'im ter th'blacksmith fer get this soce-pan off ey picked up is big 'ommer an' said: 'Just put thee yed dine on th'anvil, lad.'
Ey didna meyn it thee knowst, but it put Amos off blacksmiths.
So 'is mother 'ad fer walk Silverdeele with 'im an' tak 'im on th'tram ter 'artshill.
Thee didna 'ave much trouble gettin' 'is finger ite 'o th' iron-pipin' but th'stone pittle-jar caused a bit o' bother.
Ey 'adna towd 'is mother wot was in this pittle-jar.
When thee brok it oppen at th'Infirmary ite pops a snake.
Th'nosses squeyled an' skidaddled but it was only a gress-snake an' Amos stuffed it in 'is pocket.
But 'is mother wouldna sit at th'side on 'im on th'tram comin' back — 'er couldna abide snakes.
But it wonna lung afoer it was Amos's turn fer do a bit o' squeylin'.
At that tarme me granmother kept some leyches in a jar in th'pantry. 
'Er used luk after bad folk in th'village an' 'er was a big beleyver in lettin' a bit o' blood ite.
Whenever ey spied 'is chance, Amos 'ud go an' wetch theyse leyches in th''pantry.
Ar knew fer certin as sooner or leeter ey'd put 'is 'and in th'jar — an' ey 'did.
Ey didna get 'is 'and fast this tarme but one o' th'leyches fastened on ter 'im.
They shouldsta 'eerd 'im — ey squeyled blue- murder.
A bit touchy abite blood was Amos.
Ey come runnin' inter th'kitchin screymin' at me gran- mother fer get it off 'im.
But 'er wonna in aw that big a 'urry fer tak it off.
Er said: 'Ee, that un's got a good 'owd on thee. Ar reckon theyt goin' tell me thee didstna put thee 'and in th'jar — it just jumped up an' bit thee.'
Then 'er said: 'Dunna bey such a mard babby - it'll drop off thee when it's 'ad its fil.'
But that meede 'im ten tarmes woss.
In th'end 'er 'ad fer go an' cut a lump o' sawt off th'block fer get this leych off 'im.
But it didna larn 'im — it wonna moer than a wik or two afoer thee funt 'im with is yed stuck in th'razzervoy reelins.
Poer owd Amos!
Ar anna asleyp if that's wot theet thinkin'.
Ar con tell thee footstep anywheer.
They walkst just larke thee feyther used do - a bit 'eavy on th'keggy foot.Come in an' sit thee dine.
It's bin a puthery sort o' dee, anna it?
Ar reckon wey shan 'ave some thunder afoer lung.
Wey shan get it sooner than ar thowght.
Thee mitst as well stop wheer thee at 'til it's past ower.
In th'owd dees me mother 'ud bey goin' rind th'ice coverin' up aw th'mirrors, puttin' aw th'kneyves an' fokes an' spoons awee, drawin' th'blinds dine, an' oppenin' th'doers. 
Folks used think as if th'leyghtnin' come dine th'chimney it'd go ite through th'doer withite doin' any mischief.
When ar was a lad me mother used tell me if ever ar got caught in a thunder-storm th'best thing fer do was go ter th' middle o' a feyld an' lee dine on th'grind.
Ar thowght abite 'er a two-three yeer back when ar got owertakken be a storm dine in th'valley yonder.
But theedst luk such a foo' lyin' dine on th'grind in th' pourin' reen, wutstna?
So ar meede tracks fer wom.
Ar 'adna gone moer than a cockstride afoer ther was'a awmighty' crack.
Th'leyghtnin' 'ad struck a oak trey just up th'road.
It tuk a strip o'wood ite o' this trey from th'topmost twig ter th'grind. 
Kilt it stone jed, it did!
Ar thowght ter mesel': Jabez lad, they shouldsta done wot thee mother towd thee. If theydst bin a bit aimer tote that trey theydsta bin split reyght dine th'middle! So its dine on th'grind fer Jabez next tarme, choose wot folks think.
Theedst 'ardly beleyve it but owd Charlie wot used live in th'wheyte-weshed cottage at th bottom o' th'leene woulda slept through that thunder weyn just 'eerd.
A terrible 'eavy sleyper was owd Charlie - ey seymed fer go jed.
Dust know, sirree, 'is missus peepered th'bedroom one dee with owd Charlie asleyp in th'bed.
Ey was on neyghts at th'pit at th'tarme, but 'er was determined fer get this new peeper on th' wo' wheylst th'childer were at schoo'.
An' 'er did it an' aw.
'Er shunted th'furniture rind, an' th'bed an' aw, an' ey never 'eerd a thing.
Ey wok up when 'er was puttin' th'last peyce on.
When ey went sleyp th'wo's 'ad gotten autumn leyves on 'em, but when ey wok up thee were covered in roses.
Ey rubbed 'is eyes an lukked arind 'im an' said ter 'is missus: "Well, ar'll bey jiggered. Thers now wonder ar feyl 'ungry — ar've gone an' slept reyght through th'flippin' winter.”
Ar've gotten another spade in th'shed if thee't short o' ajob.
A bit o' diggin' 'ud do thee a world o' good.
They't puttin' a fair bit o' fat on thee bones just leetly.
Come on in, ar want show thee summat.
Wot dust meeke o' that then?
Ar musta dug a dozen or moer o' them up in me tarme.
Belonged ter me sister them did.
Yer could buy them little dolls fer a penny or twopence.
Th'bodies were meede ite o' a peyce o' rag stuffed with sawdust.
This rag was poer stuff an' it wonna lung afoer it bosted.
Me sister used pretend theyse dolls were bad when th'saw-dust started comin' ite.
'Er'd keyp stitchin' 'em up but thee soon bosted ite aggen.
When er couldna stitch 'em up anymoer 'er'd pretend thee were jed an' bury 'em in th'gardin.
Er musta spent many a lot o' Satdee pennies on theyse dolls - ar keyp comin' across 'em aw ower th'opper.
Just 'ark at yon youth.
Ey thinks ar do this diggin' fer 'is benefit - ey's bin follerin' me arind aw mornin'.
Owd thee whip a bit me owd friend — ar'm just 'avin' five.
Talkin' abite diggin' things up, 'ast ever noticed wot a lot o' owd clee-pipes ther is in th'feylds arind th'village?
They 'ave a luk in any o' th'feylds just after theen bin ploughed. In spittin' distance thee cost pick up a 'andful.o' peyces o' clee-pipe. A lot on 'em anna bin smoked eether - cleyn as a whistle thee are.
Ar've offen wondered if somebody in th'village didna meeke clee-pipes at one tarme.
Did ar ever tell thee abite th'fost smoke ar 'ad in a clee-pipe?
Ar'd bey in me teyns at th'tarme an' ar come across Big Jim wot used work at th'bottom farm.
Ey was ploughin' that feyld back o' th'Chapel an' ey'd got dine under th'edge fer a bite o'snappin'.
When ey'd finished 'is bread an' cheyse ey cut a bit o' thick-twist an' put it on top o' th'dottle in 'is owd clee-pipe an' lit up.
It smelt grand!
This clee-pipe 'ad burnt ter th'colour o' meersham.
Th'stem was ony abite a couple o' inches lung, an' th'bowl were just under 'is nose.
Ar'd smoked many a lot o'dreyd leyves in a acorn pipe with a peyce o' straw stuck in it, but ar'd never smoked any reyl bacca.
Ar eksed 'im if it teested as good as it smelt, an' ey said. "Thers nowt larke findin' things 'ite fer theesel'", an' ey give me 'ispipe.
Ar didna 'afe fancy mesel' with this clee-pipe but it wonna lung afoer ar began feyl a bit funny.
Big Jim said: "Wot's up me owd cock-sparrer? Theyt lukkin' a bit greyn arind th'gills."
Just nar owd Big Jim started goin' rind an' rind, an' then th'osses started goin' rind an' rind, an' then Big Jim an' th'osses aw started goin' rind th'Chapel.
Ee! ar did feyl bad sirree.
Ar managed fer get on me feyt an' stagger ter th'geete but th'geete wouldna stand still eether.
Then aw of a sudden th'grind come up an' 'it me.
Ar dunna remember much after that but ar've never fancied a clee-pipe since.
Didst 'ave gas or cocaine?
Ar meyn when thee 'adst thee 'air cut.
Ar reckon it musta bin reyght peenful fer 'ave them two-three 'airs o' thine cut as short as that.
It's a wonder ter mey as that barber con give thee thee money's woth withite meekin' thee as bawd as an egg!
Ey dunna charge thee full price, does he?
At one tarme ther used bey an owd collier in th'village wot did a bit o' 'air-cuttin' an' sheevin'.
Ar dunna reyghtly remember if it was a penny or tuppence fer a 'aircut but it was one o' th'two.
Us lads 'ad fer go on a Satdee mornin'.
Ar tried fer get ite o' goin' if ar could, 'cos ther were a lot moer interestin' things fer a lad fer do on a Satdee mornin' than 'avin' 'is 'air cut.
Ey did this 'air-cuttin' an' sheevin' in th'kitchin.
Ey used put a cushin on one o' th'kitchin cheers fer us lads an' thee 'adst er kneyl on this cushin an' lee owd o' th'back o' th'cheer.
Ey awwees 'ad a canary in a keege 'angin' up on th'wo' an' thee 'adst keyp lukkin' at this canary so's theedst keyp thee yed still.
Ar dunna think ey'd larned any barberin' anywheer — ar reckon ey'd picked it up as ey went alung.
Mind thee, considerin' ey were moer used ter 'andlin' a pick an' shovel than a comb an' scissors, ey didna do aw that bad a job.
Thee lukst a bit larke a shorn lamb when ey'd finished with thee but it lasted thee a lung wheyle.
Ar never walk up this road withite thinkin' abite th'tarme ar went bilberrin' with me Uncle Danny.
Ey'd 'eerd tell as ther was a good crop o' bilberries in a wood t'other side o' Keyle.
It was one 'olidee tarme just afoer ar left schoo', an' ey tuk me with 'im. 
It's a back-breekin' job bilberrin' is, inna it?
A lot o' folks musta 'eerd abite theyse bilberries though, 'cos be th' tarme wey got theer th'bushes 'ad bin welly stripped.
Wey were in that wood practically aw dee an' wey ony got abite a couple o' pynd apeyce. 
Anyroad, wey were just comin' back through Keyle when this bloke stops us an' says in a lah-di- dah sort o' voice: "Where did you get those bilberries from ?"
Uncle Danny lukked this bloke up an' dine, an' ey didna seym fer tak to 'im 'cos ey said: "Wot's it got do with they wheer weyn 'ad 'em from? They mind thee own business."
Ar thowght Uncle Danny were beyin' abit sharp with this bloke 'cos ey lukked a deycent enough soul.
Thee couldst tell ey 'adna bin born in theyse parts though be th'funny road ey spok.
But ey musta cottoned-on as ey wonna goin' get very fer with Uncle Danny, so ey spok ter mey.
Ey wanted know if ar'd sel 'im mebilberries - ey said ey'd give mey a shillin' fer 'em.
Ar thowght abite aw th'things ar could do with a bob, an' wheylst ar was thinkin' abite it this mon said: "Where did you say you got them from?"
Ar were just goin' fer tell 'im when Uncle Danny tipped me th'wink fer keep me trap shut.
This bloke kept rattlin' th'money in 'is pocket an' eksin' me wheer weyd bin.
Ar didna know wot fer do — ar coulda bought now end o' things with a bob in them dees.
An' then ar thowght abite th'teeste o' that bilberry pie wot me mother 'ud meeke, an' then me mythe started weyterin when ar thowght abite that bilberry an' apple dumplin' ar was goin 'ave.
In th'end me bally won th'dee — ar said ar wonna goin' sell 'em.
When wey'd gotten ite o' ear-shot Uncle Danny said: "Ee! they 'adst me on tenterhooks fer a wheyle, lad. Dust know who that bloke was? Ey bought that bilberry-wood a two-three yeer back wot weyn just trampled aw ower. If theydst towd 'im wheer theedst bin ey'd 'ad us in court next wik. An' thee dunna 'ave a bilberry pie in gaol thee knowst — only bread an' weyter".
Ar could wreyte a book abite th'dogs weyn 'ad in this village.
Ar reckon thers as much difference betweyn dogs as ther is betweyn folks.
Thers good uns an' bad uns, an' thers clever uns an' mad uns,
Thers them thee cost trust with thee leyfe, an' thers them thee costna trust any further than thee cost spit.
But th'queerest dog weyn ever 'ad in th'village was one neemed Turk.
Funny neeme fer a dog, wonna it?
Ey was wot ar caw a liquoreece dog.
Ey was aw sorts — a bit o' this an' a bit o' that an' a bit 'o' everythin' else.
Th'dog was 'armless enough but ey didna 'afe luk funny.
An' th'funniest thing abite 'im was ey walked sideroads. 
'Is back-end didna foller 'is front-end — if thee seyst wot ar meyn.
Folks reckoned ey'd bin sut on when ey was a pup an' ey'd sort o' got twisted rind a bit.
Ey lived ter a good age though, an' ey didna seym fer mind folks laughin' at 'im.
An' then ther was one neemed Rex.
Ey was a different kettle o' fish awgether.
Ey was one o' th'best-lukkin' collies ar've ever seyn — ey was a beauty.
Yer felt as though yer just 'ad fer stroke 'im an' pat 'im, an' tel 'im wot a grand-lukkin' dog ey was.
But that's when folks funt ite wot a grand set o' teyth ey'd gotten.
Ey couldna bear anybody touch 'is yed.
Theydst ony got pat 'is yed an' ey'd 'ave thee 'and in 'is mythe up ter thee elber.
Then ther was that big black un wot thee cawed Prince. 
'Ast ever nowticed as some dogs seym fer 'ave a grudge aggenst certin folks?
This dog belonged a widder-woman wot lived with a married doter.
Th'doter's 'usband was a sowjer so thee didna sey much on 'im, an' th'dog were company fer em.
Ey was a good dog but ther was one or two folks wot ey couldna stand th'seyght on.
One o' th'folks ey 'ad a grudge aggenst was a relative o' theyse women — a mon neemed Frank.
Ey lived dine th'other end o' th'village an' ey used 'elp 'em with th'gardin an' suchlarke.
But whenever ey come ter th'ice theyse women 'ad fasten th'dog up somewheer.
Ey'da etten Franky if ey'd gotten at 'im.
Dust know, that dog could tell as soon as Franky lifted th'latch on th'geete.
Uncanny it was.
Franky 'adna got put 'is foot on th'path afoer th'dog 'ud bey barkin' an' growlin' behind th'doer.
Anyroad, one mornin', when theyse women got up owd Prince seymed fer bey poerly.
Ey was under th'big chest o' drawers in th'kitchin an' ey wouldna come ite.
Thee tried ticin 'im ite with aw sorts o' titbits but it was now good.
Tote dinner-tarme thee began fer get worried abite 'im, an' when th'doter got dine on th'floer fer 'ave a luk under this chest o' drawers, 'er started blartin'.
Er said ey was as cowd as ice an' ey musta gone jed in th'neyght.
So thee both started blartin' an' then th'doter said 'er'd better go an' get Franky fer 'elp 'em shift th'drawers an bury poer owd Prince in th'gardin.
Franky wonna in at th'tarme but 'is missus said 'er'd send 'im across as soon as ey come wom.
So theyse two women sat comfortin' one another an' talkin' abite wot a good dog ey'd bin.
Thee said thee'd get another pup as soon as thee could fer tak ther minds off it.
An' then aw of a suddin Prince shot ite from under th' chest o' drawers larke a rocket, an' was barkin' an' growlin' at th'doer.
It could ony meyn one thing - ey'd 'eerd Franky comin' fer bury 'im.
Theyse women couldna beleyve ther eyes, an' thee never did manage fer convince Franky as thee 'adna bin 'avin' 'im on.`;
