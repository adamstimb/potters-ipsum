const jabez = `Ey was nice a lad but ar dunna think ey'd in the country afoer.
Th'fost dee when ey come ite fer plee with us wey tuk 'im dine th'feylds.
That lad's mother shoulda 'ad moer sense than turn 'im ite in a good suit an' a pair o' fancy shoes.
It inna exactly th'sort o' thing fer wear when thee't climbin' treys an' messin' abite dine th'feylds.
We 'adna gone very fer afoer ey slipped on a fresh-done cow-flop an' finished up on 'is backside.
That didna do 'is trysers any good fer a start.
Wey scraped some on it off with a peyce o' stick an' then weyped 'im dine with 'andfuls o' gress.
Ey didna seym fer bey aw that gain on 'is feyt - p'raps it was with beyin' used ter walkin' on th'level dine London.
Be th'tarme wey'd climbed a trey or two an' pleed in th'bruk an' rind th'basselows that suit ey'd gotten on was ready fer th'rag-mon, an 'is fancy shoes were wet through an' laubed up with clee.
Th'lad's mother got on to us when 'er seyd 'im.
'Er said wey'd done it on purpose, but wey 'adna.
Th'lad 'ad just tried fer do wot wey did an' ey wonna very good at it.
Ey were frittened death o' animals o' aw sorts.
Thee couldstna get 'im  anywheer near a steeble, or a pigstee, or a feyld o' cows.
An' th'poer lad were a bit tickle-stomached ower smells.
Ar remember wey tuk 'im in th'farmyard one dee fer show 'im rind.
Th'farmer 'appened fer bey cartin' muck at th'tarme an' this lad started coughin' an' 'eavin - ar thowght ey were goin' bey sick on th'spot.
It gets a bit owerpowerin' when its forked up, dunna it?
Mind thee, ar reckon it's a good 'ealthy smell fer aw that.
But 'ey fergot aw abite th'smell when th'owd gander put 'is neck ite an' come fer 'im.
Ey sqeuyled larke a stuck pig an' ran off dine th'village ter 'is mother.
But ar nowticed as when theyse lads funt ite wot a lot o' pocket-money ey'd gotten thee aw gethered rind fer 'elp 'im spend it!
This lad 'ad a funny road o' talkin' - wey couldna understand 'im at fost.
Mind thee, it wonna is fawt - aw them London folk talk bit funny, dunna thee?
Are remember tellin' 'im wey didna put 'batter' on us bread up this road - wey meede pon-cakes ite on it!
After a few wiks, wey'd larned 'im a thing or two an' ey was beginnin' fer luk a bit larke a village lad.
Wot dust think ey said to us when it were tarme fer 'im got back London?
Ey said: 'Ar'll come an' sey yer aggen as soon as ar con!'
So, thee seyst, wey'd larned 'im fer talk reyght an' aw.
Mind thee, th'lad's mother didna think so when 'er 'eerd 'im!
Ar remember takkin' a message fer a woman wot was a bit of skin-flint.
'Er said 'er'd pee me when are got back.
Ar was ony a bit of a lad an' it was gettin' on fer threy miles theer an' back.
On th'road wom ar was wonderin' if 'er'd give me a penny or twopence, an' are was plannin' wot ar'd buy with it.
In me mind's eye ar spent that money ower an' ower aggen.
Anyroad, when are got back 'er said: 'Ar'll give thee summat next tarme ar sey thee - ar anna got any cheenge.'
For prove it 'er tuk a ten-bob note ite o' 'er poss an' 'eld it up.
But ar'd 'eerd th'chink o' oney when 'er oppened th'poss.
Ar thowght: 'Jabez lad, 'er's coddin' thee.  'Er's fer doin' thee ite o' thee money.'
So ar said: 'That's awreyght, ar'll get it cheenged fer yer,' an' ar snatched th'note ite o' 'er and an' went beltin' fer th'shop.
Ar towd th'shop-woman ar didna want any coppers in th'cheenge - just silver.
Ar thowght ter messel' 'er'll 'ave give me a tanner nar, an' it sarves 'er reyght fer tryin' diddle me.
But bless mey, when ar tuk th'cheenge back 'er said: 'Wost dust think Jabez?  Ar've funt a penny lyin' abite wot ar didna know ar'd gotten.'
Ar reckon them folks wot cawed 'er a skin-flint wonner fer ite.
Talkin' abite sendin' messages, thee wouldstna remember Pollymary wouldst?
'Er 'ad a sister wot lived in a little cottage in th'bottom o' th'valley.
Gettin' on fer 'afe a mile awee it was.
Pollymary used shyte messages to 'er.
It dunna seym possible does it?
But 'er 'ad a reyght good pair o' lungs an' 'er voice travlled well dine that valley.
'Er used come ter th'top o' th'bonk an' cup 'er 'ands rind 'er mythe an' shyte 'Coo-ee. Coo-ee.'
Just nar 'er sister 'ud come ter th'doer an' thee'd bey shytin' ter one another fer many a wheyle.
But wey pleed a trick on 'er one dee.
Ther were two on us pleein' in th'gorse-bushes 'afe-wee dine th'feylds when Pollymary come fer 'ave a shyte ter 'er sister.
Th'sister's 'usband musta bin poerly, 'cos Pollymary shyted: 'Is Billy any better?'
Wey got behin th'bushes an' imitated th'sister's voice an shyted up: 'Billy's jed.'
Wey didna think 'er'd bey takken in as easy as that, but 'er was.
'Er come runnin' dine th'feylds an' wey expected 'er go neck an' crop any minute.
'Er 'ad fer 'ave a bacca at th'second stile - th'owd lass was blowin' larke brokken-winded 'oss.
Wey didna stop fer find ite wot 'appened when 'er got ter 'er sisters.
Pollymary was a big woman - 'er coulda picked both on us up be th'scruff o' th'neck an' banged us yeds 'gether.
Mind thee, ar think wey desarved it, dustna they?
At comin' in?
Ee, that brought back some memories.
'Er used live in th'village as a child but 'er lives off Leyk road nar.
It's a good many yeers since ar seyd 'er.
Wey were just talkin' abite some o' th'things wey did an' some o' th'owd folk we could remember.
Ar used plee with 'er a lot afoer wey were owd enough go schoo'.
'Er was as pretty as a picture an' 'er could twist me rind 'er little finger.
One o' me earliest memories was beyin' with 'er in a feyld at th'back o' their 'ice.
Wey couldna 'ave bin moer than threy or foer yeer owd.
'Er beleyved in fairies an' 'er towd me as theyse fairies popped ite o' flowers when thee opened ther petals.
Wey sat wetchin' some buttercups an' deesies for many a wheyle but ar never seyd any fairies - 'er said it was because ar didna beleyve in 'em!
It's funny wot little things stick in thee mind, inna it?
Ar reminded 'er abite th'tarme when 'er used send me inter th'middins.
Them folks wot lived in th'terrace 'ises didna 'ave dust-bins in them dees - thee 'ad big brick middins fer put ther esses an' rubbish in.
This lass used send me ferritin' abite in theyse middins fer find peyces o' brokken pleetes an' owd socepans an' things so's 'er could plee 'ises with 'em.
Th'teeble 'ud bey an erring-box with a peyce o' owd wo'-peeper on it fer a teeble-cloth.
Th'dresser was another box, or a pile o' bricks, with a jamjar full o' weyld flowers on it, an' ther'd bey an owd bag on th'floer fer a carpet.
Ar was supposed fer bey th'usband an' ar 'ad fer eat aw sorts o' stuff off theyse brokken pleetes - raw taters an' chonnucks, aw sorts o' berries, 'awthorn buds fer cheyse, vetch pods fer peys, an' them little read an' yeller flowers wot wey cawed eggs an' beecon.
Ar 'ad fer wesh it dine with cowd weyter ite o' an owd cracked cup from th'middin.
It's a wonder ar didna 'ave bally-ache or woss!
Er was tellin' me it was mey wot larned 'er fer swing a canful o' milk withite spillin' any.
Wey used fetch th'milk from th'farm in a can with a weyer 'andle an' a lid.
When thee gotst th'knack on it thee couldst tak th'lid off an' swing th'can rind an' rind thee yed withite any comin' ite.
Mind thee, it was best fer practice with weyter afoer thee triedst it with a quart o' milk!
As this lass got owder 'er turned inter a reyght tum-boy.
When th'other wenches were pleein' 'opscotch or pleein' with ther dolls, 'er'd bey pleein' bodger or rinkers with us lads, or climbin' treys or gettin' inter some mischief on 'er own somewheer.
Fer luk at 'er nar thee wouldstna think as th'farmer once 'ad fer fish 'er ite o' th'pig-swill barrel.
'Er'd bin missin rind th'farm an' decided fer feyd th'pigs.
Th'trouble was th'barrel was neyly empty an' when 'er leyned ower th'side fer ladle some ite 'er owerbalanced an' fell in!
'Er musta stunk summat terrible 'cos th'farmer 'ad fer pour buckets o' weyter ower 'er afoer ey dost let 'er go wom.
'Er mother used despair on 'er at tarmes.
Ar remember takkin' 'er wom one dee when 'er'd gashed 'er leg open on some barbed weyer.
Ar towd 'er mother 'er'd lost a lot o' blood but dust know wot 'er mother said?
'Er said: 'It'll do 'er good! 'Er could do with some o' that mad blood lettin' ite on 'er.
But 'er was a grand lass fer aw that.
Ar reckon that bloke wot wrote that hymn 'O day of rest an' gladness' adna 'eerd abite theyse local preychers trampin' up an' dine th'country, it wonna exactly a rest-dee for them.
Tak owd Daniel fer instance.
Ey musta preyched fer nigh on 50 yeer.
Ar con remember one Sundee mornin' when ey eksed me if ar'd larke go with 'im ter a little chapel off Crewe road.
Ar'd bey in me early twenties at th'tarme.
Wey'd just come ite o' Sundee Schoo' an' ey was goin' tak th'Harvest Festival services at this chapel.
It was a nice dee at th'back-end o' September so ar said: 'Awreyght, ar'll go with thee fer company. Wot tarms are we startin' off?'
Ey said wey were goin' nar - straight awee.
Ey reckoned it'd tak us th'best part o two 'ours fer get theer, an' ey'd bin invited ter a farm-'ice fer 'is dinner an' tey.
So we struck off.
Ar soon funt ite as owd Daniel 'adna much use fer roads an' paths unless thee 'appened fer bey on th'crowline.
If thee wonna, ey just cut straight across th'feylds.
It 'ad bin a leete harvest an' there were a lot o' corn still weetin' fer bey carted.
Owd Daniel lukked at it an'said: 'There's one hymn wey shanna bey 'avin' terdee.
Wey conna sing 'All is safely gathered in' withite tellin' lies, con we?
Wey got ter this farm abite one o'clock.
Ar've never seyn ser much stuff on a dinner-teeble eether befoer or since.
Ther was enough fer feyd an army!
Ar was that famished ar 'ad me kneyfe an' foke at th'ready afoer owd Daniel 'ad finished th'grace.
Ar didna 'ear much o' 'is sermon in th'afternoon - ar was full ter bostin' an' ar think ar musta dozed off.
y. Th'farmer's weyfe thowght ther was summat up with me.
Owd Daniel did it justice though, an' ey give 'em a good threy-quarters of an 'our sermon at neyght.
Dust know, ar con still remember 'is text — it was ite o' the' Owd Testament: 'Thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy fields, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest — thou shalt leave them for the poor and the stranger.'
Th'farmer would 'ave us goin' back ter th'farm fer some supper.
Theyse farmers dunna 'afe get through some snappin'!
Wey 'ad cheyse, pittled damsons an' wom-beeked bread.
It was dark be this tarme an' wey'd got a couple o' 'ours walkin' fer do.
Anyroad, th'farmer said ey'd get th'pony an' trap ite fer tak us dine th'leene as fer as th'meen road.
Ar thowght th'farmer 'ud bey comin' with us, but ey said: 'When 'ee get ter th'meen road just turn th'pony rind an' start 'im back wom - ey'll bey awreyght.'
Wey stood an' listened fer a bit ter th'pony trottin' back up th'leene an' then owd Daniel struck off across th'feylds aggen.
Th'owd feller 'ad got bey up at 5 0'clock in th'mornin' fer go dine th'pit.
Ar reckon somebody ought ter 'ave given 'im a medal.
Come fer think on it though, p'raps SOMEBODY did!
Ther were little pits an' tunnels aw ower the'opper.
Did ar ever tell thee abite them two brothers wot dug a tunnel inter th'side o' a bonk?
Th'seym o' coal wonna much moer than a foot thick, but it was a bit o' good stuff.
Theyse brothers 'ad a box on some runners with a peyce o' rope tied ter eych end.
One on 'em 'ud crawl inter th'ole with a candle, draggin' th'box after 'im.
When ey'd filled th'box with coal, ey'd give a couple o' tugs on th'rope.
Th'other brother pulled th'box ite an' emptied it, an' then signalled fer it bey pulled back aggen.
But one dee when ey pulled th'box ite ther wonna any coal in it — ther was a bird's neyst in it with foer eggs!
Ey stood theer scrattin' 'is yed an' gawpin' at this neyst.
Ey couldna understand it but ey shyted dine th'ole: 'Dust want 'em fried or poached?'
Wot dust think 'ad 'appened, sirree?
This tunnel 'ad gone straight through th'bonk an' come ite on th'other side oa a bush!
This nest was in th'bush.
So, fer a laugh, ey'd popped it in th'box an' signalled 'is brother fer pull it ite.
Tote th'end o' th'strike, aw theyse little pits 'ad fer bey filled in.
Ther was a mon comin' fer inspect 'em at 12 o'clock on th'Satdee.
Mind thee, a lot on 'em were drawin' coal 'till th'last minute.
Two on 'em 'ad a shaft abite 20 foot deyp an' thee left it too leete fer fill th'ole in.
So thee put some branches across top o' th'ole an' covered em with clods an' threw a bit o' dirt on top.
This inspector-mon were bit suspicious abite this big pile o' dirt wot thee 'adna put back.
When ey eksed 'em abite it one o' th'owd miners said: 'Dunna worry theesel' abite that lad. It's just a bit wot wey 'ad left ower. Mey an' Charlie are goin' dig another 'ole fer put it in.'
ter on th'end o' thee arms, theydst got abite as much as thee
When theedst gotten a couple o' two-gallon buckets o' couldst manage.
Mind thee, ar awwees reckoned as two buckets on a 'oop were better than maulin' with 'em one at a tarme — thee wast moer balanced, larke.
But it didna 'afe give thee fingers wot fer on a cowd winter's mornin'!
Ther was neyly awwees a bit o' 'oss-plee goin' on dine th'wood-well.
One o' th'tricks thee used plee on thee was fer lee 'owd o' one o' th'buckets o' weyter an' pull thee rind an' rind withit.
Ther was nowt much thee couldst do abite it 'cept go rind larke a top inside th'oop.
Theyse two buckets welly pulled thee arms ite o' ther sockets.
Dust know wot it used put me in mind on? - them steym guvnor things wot thee 'ad on th'weyndin' injin at th'pit.
If thee putst thee buckets dine afoer theetst stopped spinnin' aw th' weyter tipped ite, an' then thee 'adst go aw th'wee back ter th'well fer some moer.
After a spell o' drey weather th'weyter ony dribbled ite o' this spring an' it used tak many a wheyle fer fill a bucket.
Them as 'ad proper wells were best off.
Most on 'em were in gardins, but ar remember two wot were inside th'ice — under th'scullery floer.
Ther was a knack, thee knowst, ter gettin' weyter ite o' theyse wells.
Thee 'adst fer drop thee bucket in gentle so's thee didstna churn up th'muck at th'bottom.
Then thee givst th'rope a flick so's th'bucket tipped ower on its side.
Some o' theyse wells were a good depth, an' thee wonna cleyned aw that offen.
Theydst bey surprised at some o' th' things wot were funt dine 'em.
Owd 'ats an' shoes, clee-pipes an' tins 0' bacca, wetches, lumps o' scrap-iron, an' nar an' aggen a bit o' money.
Course ther were awwees a bucket or two at th'bottom, an' a two-three lenths o' owd rope.
Ar remember seyin' an owd wooden bucket wot 'ad come ite o' a well.
It musta bin dine fer donkey's yeers but it 'ud still 'owd weyter.
Ther was offen a frog or two swimmin' arind, but ar think lads musta put 'em in 'cos folks were very perticler abite coverin' th'well up.
In them dees, cleyn weyter was only used fer drinkin' an' cookin' an' such-larke.
Thee used reen-weyter or pond-weyter fer most everythin' else.
Ar'll tell thee wot sirree, nar weyn aw gotten taps in th'ice ar never grumble abite peein' me weyter rate.
Tt's a wonder ter mey as some o' them colliers didna 'ave ther 'ises burnt dine with aw them close rind th'fire.
Mind thee, one or two on 'em neyly managed it.
Ar remember one on 'em tellin' me abite th'tarme when 'is missus wok up in th'middle o' th'neyght an' said: 'Weeke up Tum ar can smell burnin'.'
Ey towd 'er get of sleyp with 'er, but 'er wouldna rest
Er werritted that much ey 'ad fer get up.
When ey oppened th'stair-foot doer th'kitchen was full o' smoke!
Ey shyted: 'Nell! Theyst better come dine - me trysers are on fire.'
Er said: 'Oh my lors, Costna dite 'em?'
Tum shyted back: 'Ar've dited em but ar shanna bey eeble go work in 'em — thers oles in th'legs big enough get thee yed through.'
When 'er come dine 'er said ey 'adna got an moer fer go in.
Ther was ony 'is best blue an' 'is flannels, an' 'er wonner lettin' 'im go in them.
So 'er funt a peyce o' cloth ite 'o th'rag-bag an' petched 'em fer 'im.
Then 'er said: 'Them'll 'ave do. Ar conna sey wot ar'm doin' withite me glasses an' ar'm blessed if ar con think wheer ar've put 'em. Theyt 'ave manage with 'em 'till ar con get thee a' pair o' mowl-skins ite o' th'maxim.'
So thee went back bed an' th'next thing 'er remembered was Tum shytin': 'Nell! Come dine quick. Ar'm in a reyght' mess — ar've lost th'use o' me leg!'
'Er said: 'Theyst wot? Wotever's up with thee nar?'
So ey shyted back. 'Well, eether ar'm paralysed from the weest dine or else theyst meede'a reyght owd cobble' o' theyse trysers. Ar conna move.'
Dust know wot 'er'd done, sirree?
Some road or other er'd stitched th'legs 'gether betweyn th'kneys.
'Ee!' ey said.  'They 'adst me worried fer a bit. Next tarme thee mendest me trysers in th'middle o' th'neyght meeke sure fer put 'thee specs on. Ar was beginnin' fer think theydst 'ave push me work in th'wheyl-barrer.'
id as we watched one of the early combine-harvesters at work.
Ar reckon every dog 'as its dee.
At one tarme th'corn were awwees cut wi' a sickle or a scythe.
Then th'reypin' macheynes come, an' then th'beynders, an' nar this greet lummockin' contraption.
Thee cost 'ardly credit as when th'childer livin' nar get owd thee'll luk back an' tell their childer wot a grand seyght it was fer wetch this greet thing go through a feyld spewin' ite corn an' straw.
Ar wonder wot some o' th'owd uns 'ud think abite it?
In them dees, two acres o' wuts was a good dee's work fer a mon wi' a scythe.
An' then it 'ad fer bey put up in sheyves an' stooked.
Th'owd folks used reckon fer leyve th'stooks standin' on th'stubble 'till it 'ad 'eerd th'church bells ring on threy Sundees.
Then it 'ad fer bey carted an' stacked fer weet fer th'thresher come rind.
Ar'll tell thee wot though, ar used enjoy beyin' in th'arvest feyld in th'owd dees.
Mind thee, it was 'ard work an' th'dees were lung an' th'pee were poer.
But some-road or other folks seymed fer bey moer contented.
Ar'm aw in favour o' takkin' th'ard work ite o' a job providin' a mon con get some satisfaction ite o' doin' wot's left.
As ar luk at it, a mon's got fer bey comfortable with 'imsel', if thee gets me meynin'.
An' if ey dunna get some satisfaction ite o' 'is job it's as sure as God meede little apple thers trouble brewin' fer somebody somewheer. 
Theyt sey folks at th'arvest festival wot thee wutna sey at any other service bar a buryin' or a marryin'.
It inna aw that lung ago since a good 'arvest meant th' difference betweyn a full bally an' a empty 'un in th'winter.
Thers bin a two-three cheenges since then but a mon still conna do withite 'is snappin'.
Wey con do some clever things but ar anna 'eerd tell abite a mon meekin' a bleede o' gress yet, let alone a grain o' corn.
Ar reckon that's th'top an' bottom on it.
Ar used larke sey a lad tackle a good peyce.
Them peyces were as thick as doer-steps.
It was now use 'eksin' 'im fer seeve thee th'crusses though - ey eat them fost. 
An' th'sparrers didna get very fat on th'crumbs eether.
Ar think ar towd thee as when ar was a bit of a lad ar used go rind with th'butcher-mon in 'is pony an' trap.
Ther was one thing wot puzzled me fer a lung tarme — th'poerest family in th'village 'ad th'biggest parcel o' meyt.
Dust know wot it was, sirree? A greet big lump o' udder, an' thee 'ad it neyly every wik-end.
Ar didna fancy it mesel' but ar reckon it was eether that or nothin' fer th'poer souls.
Another thing that family used 'ave a lot on was breadpuddin'.
Ther musta bin seven or eight childer at th'tarme ar'm speykin' abite. 
Ar could never keyp kynt o' them childer — ther awwees seymed fer bey another un since th'last kynt.
Anyroad, 'er used meeke this puddin' in a big jowl.
Ar 'ad many a lot on it.
Ar used plee with some o' theyse childer an' when thee were 'avin' bread-puddin' fer ther dinners thee'd eks me fer 'ave some.
Ther was nowbody could meeke bread-puddin' larke that woman.
Th'top on it 'ud bey neyce an' crisp with some bryn sugar on it.
'Er put aw sorts o' things in it - a bit o' rhubub or a two-three goose-gogs, or some wind-blown apples, or black-berries, or owt wot was in seyson.
When 'er 'adna got owt else, 'er'd put some currans or reesons in, but when thee funst one thee 'adst fer shyte 'oo-ray 'cos ther'd ony bey a 'andful on 'em in that big jowl.
One o' th'little lads used put me off a bit though: Ey awwees seymed fer 'ave a couple o' candles runnin' dine 'is nose on ter 'is puddin'.
Mind thee, th'little chap couldna 'elp it, ey 'ad one o' them everlastin' cowds in th'yed.
Ey'd never 'ad a proper 'enkerchief an' 'is gansy-sleyve were a bit rough on is little nose.
But it was rattlin' good breadpuddin'.
That's a geeme wot's stood th'test o' tarme.
Wey used scrat a cirtle on th'grind abite foer foot across, an' us lads 'ud put a scoer' or moer taws in it apeyce.
Ther'd bey threy or foer 'undred awgether in this cirtle.
Then wey'd draw a mark abite 30 yards awee, an' slat this iron pitcher at th'taws in us turn.
Th'idea was fer drop it just in front o' th'cirtle so's it skidded inter theyse taws an' knocked 'em ite.
They couldst 'ave aw them wot went iteside th'cirtle.
Mind thee, a lot on 'em got brok, 'specially if thee 'appenst fer ower- pitch it an' drop reyght on top on 'em.
It peed thee fer stand well back when somebody else was pitchin' — some on 'em slat a bit weyld an' that theer iron pitcher coulda takken thee yed off thee showders.
Ar've offen wondered if peggy wonna th' meekin' o' some o' th'good cricketers weyn 'ad in th'village.
An ar'll tell thee another geeme wot thee dustna sey pleed nar-a-rees — bodger!
Ee! Ar've welly brok me back a tarme or two pleein' bodger.
Foer lads on each seyd were abite th'best number, with th'fattest 'un fer th'bally-bunter.
Th'bally-bunter stood with 'is back ter a wo' an' one o' th'lads bent dine with is yed in this bally-bunter's bally.
Then th'other two bent dine an' cushioned ther yeds in th'backside o' th'lad in front on 'em.
When thee'd aw gotten dine th'other foer lads wot were goin' fogger 'ad fer on ter theyse threy lads' backs.
Th'fost lad wot jumped 'ad fer try an' clear th'fost two backs an'land on th'third un.
If ey didna it meant as ther was ony one back left fer aw th'other threy lads fer jump on to.
It was now joke 'avin' threy 'efty lads on thee back, an' aw on 'em fangin' 'owd on thee some-wheer so's thee wouldna fo' off.
Thee 'ad fer stee theer withite touchin' th'grind 'till one on 'em 'ad kynted two, foer, six, eight, ten, bodger!
Ar'll tell thee wot sirree, some o'th'lads weyn gotten nar-a-dees wouldna get inter ser much trouble if thee 'ad some o' th' stuffin' knocked ite on 'em with a two-three geemes o' peggy or bodger.`;
