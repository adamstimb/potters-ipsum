const jabez = `Ey was nice a lad but ar dunna think ey'd in the country afoer.
Th'fost dee when ey come ite fer plee with us wey tuk 'im dine th'feylds.
That lad's mother shoulda 'ad moer sense than turn 'im ite in a good suit an' a pair o' fancy shoes.
It inna exactly th'sort o' thing fer wear when thee't climbin' treys an' messin' abite dine th'feylds.
We 'adna gone very fer afoer ey slipped on a fresh-done cow-flop an' finished up on 'is backside.
That didna do 'is trysers any good fer a start.
Wey scraped some on it off with a peyce o' stick an' then weyped 'im dine with 'andfuls o' gress.
Ey didna seym fer bey aw that gain on 'is feyt - p'raps it was with beyin' used ter walkin' on th'level dine London.
Be th'tarme wey'd climbed a trey or two an' pleed in th'bruk an' rind th'basselows that suit ey'd gotten on was ready fer th'rag-mon, an 'is fancy shoes were wet through an' laubed up with clee.
Th'lad's mother got on to us when 'er seyd 'im.
'Er said wey'd done it on purpose, but wey 'adna.
Th'lad 'ad just tried fer do wot wey did an' ey wonna very good at it.
Ey were frittened death o' animals o' aw sorts.
Thee couldstna get 'im  anywheer near a steeble, or a pigstee, or a feyld o' cows.
An' th'poer lad were a bit tickle-stomached ower smells.
Ar remember wey tuk 'im in th'farmyard one dee fer show 'im rind.
Th'farmer 'appened fer bey cartin' muck at th'tarme an' this lad started coughin' an' 'eavin - ar thowght ey were goin' bey sick on th'spot.
It gets a bit owerpowerin' when its forked up, dunna it?
Mind thee, ar reckon it's a good 'ealthy smell fer aw that.
But 'ey fergot aw abite th'smell when th'owd gander put 'is neck ite an' come fer 'im.
Ey sqeuyled larke a stuck pig an' ran off dine th'village ter 'is mother.
But ar nowticed as when theyse lads funt ite wot a lot o' pocket-money ey'd gotten thee aw gethered rind fer 'elp 'im spend it!
This lad 'ad a funny road o' talkin' - wey couldna understand 'im at fost.
Mind thee, it wonna is fawt - aw them London folk talk bit funny, dunna thee?
Are remember tellin' 'im wey didna put 'batter' on us bread up this road - wey meede pon-cakes ite on it!
After a few wiks, wey'd larned 'im a thing or two an' ey was beginnin' fer luk a bit larke a village lad.
Wot dust think ey said to us when it were tarme fer 'im got back London?
Ey said: 'Ar'll come an' sey yer aggen as soon as ar con!'
So, thee seyst, wey'd larned 'im fer talk reyght an' aw.
Mind thee, th'lad's mother didna think so when 'er 'eerd 'im!
Ar remember takkin' a message fer a woman wot was a bit of skin-flint.
'Er said 'er'd pee me when are got back.
Ar was ony a bit of a lad an' it was gettin' on fer threy miles theer an' back.
On th'road wom ar was wonderin' if 'er'd give me a penny or twopence, an' are was plannin' wot ar'd buy with it.
In me mind's eye ar spent that money ower an' ower aggen.
Anyroad, when are got back 'er said: 'Ar'll give thee summat next tarme ar sey thee - ar anna got any cheenge.'
For prove it 'er tuk a ten-bob note ite o' 'er poss an' 'eld it up.
But ar'd 'eerd th'chink o' oney when 'er oppened th'poss.
Ar thowght: 'Jabez lad, 'er's coddin' thee.  'Er's fer doin' thee ite o' thee money.'
So ar said: 'That's awreyght, ar'll get it cheenged fer yer,' an' ar snatched th'note ite o' 'er and an' went beltin' fer th'shop.
Ar towd th'shop-woman ar didna want any coppers in th'cheenge - just silver.
Ar thowght ter messel' 'er'll 'ave give me a tanner nar, an' it sarves 'er reyght fer tryin' diddle me.
But bless mey, when ar tuk th'cheenge back 'er said: 'Wost dust think Jabez?  Ar've funt a penny lyin' abite wot ar didna know ar'd gotten.'
Ar reckon them folks wot cawed 'er a skin-flint wonner fer ite.
Talkin' abite sendin' messages, thee wouldstna remember Pollymary wouldst?
'Er 'ad a sister wot lived in a little cottage in th'bottom o' th'valley.
Gettin' on fer 'afe a mile awee it was.
Pollymary used shyte messages to 'er.
It dunna seym possible does it?
But 'er 'ad a reyght good pair o' lungs an' 'er voice travlled well dine that valley.
'Er used come ter th'top o' th'bonk an' cup 'er 'ands rind 'er mythe an' shyte 'Coo-ee. Coo-ee.'
Just nar 'er sister 'ud come ter th'doer an' thee'd bey shytin' ter one another fer many a wheyle.
But wey pleed a trick on 'er one dee.
Ther were two on us pleein' in th'gorse-bushes 'afe-wee dine th'feylds when Pollymary come fer 'ave a shyte ter 'er sister.
Th'sister's 'usband musta bin poerly, 'cos Pollymary shyted: 'Is Billy any better?'
Wey got behin th'bushes an' imitated th'sister's voice an shyted up: 'Billy's jed.'
Wey didna think 'er'd bey takken in as easy as that, but 'er was.
'Er come runnin' dine th'feylds an' wey expected 'er go neck an' crop any minute.
'Er 'ad fer 'ave a bacca at th'second stile - th'owd lass was blowin' larke brokken-winded 'oss.
Wey didna stop fer find ite wot 'appened when 'er got ter 'er sisters.
Pollymary was a big woman - 'er coulda picked both on us up be th'scruff o' th'neck an' banged us yeds 'gether.
Mind thee, ar think wey desarved it, dustna they?
At comin' in?
Ee, that brought back some memories.
'Er used live in th'village as a child but 'er lives off Leyk road nar.
It's a good many yeers since ar seyd 'er.
Wey were just talkin' abite some o' th'things wey did an' some o' th'owd folk we could remember.
Ar used plee with 'er a lot afoer wey were owd enough go schoo'.
'Er was as pretty as a picture an' 'er could twist me rind 'er little finger.
One o' me earliest memories was beyin' with 'er in a feyld at th'back o' their 'ice.
Wey couldna 'ave bin moer than threy or foer yeer owd.
'Er beleyved in fairies an' 'er towd me as theyse fairies popped ite o' flowers when thee opened ther petals.
Wey sat wetchin' some buttercups an' deesies for many a wheyle but ar never seyd any fairies - 'er said it was because ar didna beleyve in 'em!
It's funny wot little things stick in thee mind, inna it?
Ar reminded 'er abite th'tarme when 'er used send me inter th'middins.
Them folks wot lived in th'terrace 'ises didna 'ave dust-bins in them dees - thee 'ad big brick middins fer put ther esses an' rubbish in.
This lass used send me ferritin' abite in theyse middins fer find peyces o' brokken pleetes an' owd socepans an' things so's 'er could plee 'ises with 'em.
Th'teeble 'ud bey an erring-box with a peyce o' owd wo'-peeper on it fer a teeble-cloth.
Th'dresser was another box, or a pile o' bricks, with a jamjar full o' weyld flowers on it, an' ther'd bey an owd bag on th'floer fer a carpet.
Ar was supposed fer bey th'usband an' ar 'ad fer eat aw sorts o' stuff off theyse brokken pleetes - raw taters an' chonnucks, aw sorts o' berries, 'awthorn buds fer cheyse, vetch pods fer peys, an' them little read an' yeller flowers wot wey cawed eggs an' beecon.
Ar 'ad fer wesh it dine with cowd weyter ite o' an owd cracked cup from th'middin.
It's a wonder ar didna 'ave bally-ache or woss!
Er was tellin' me it was mey wot larned 'er fer swing a canful o' milk withite spillin' any.
Wey used fetch th'milk from th'farm in a can with a weyer 'andle an' a lid.
When thee gotst th'knack on it thee couldst tak th'lid off an' swing th'can rind an' rind thee yed withite any comin' ite.
Mind thee, it was best fer practice with weyter afoer thee triedst it with a quart o' milk!
As this lass got owder 'er turned inter a reyght tum-boy.
When th'other wenches were pleein' 'opscotch or pleein' with ther dolls, 'er'd bey pleein' bodger or rinkers with us lads, or climbin' treys or gettin' inter some mischief on 'er own somewheer.
Fer luk at 'er nar thee wouldstna think as th'farmer once 'ad fer fish 'er ite o' th'pig-swill barrel.
'Er'd bin missin rind th'farm an' decided fer feyd th'pigs.
Th'trouble was th'barrel was neyly empty an' when 'er leyned ower th'side fer ladle some ite 'er owerbalanced an' fell in!
'Er musta stunk summat terrible 'cos th'farmer 'ad fer pour buckets o' weyter ower 'er afoer ey dost let 'er go wom.
'Er mother used despair on 'er at tarmes.
Ar remember takkin' 'er wom one dee when 'er'd gashed 'er leg open on some barbed weyer.
Ar towd 'er mother 'er'd lost a lot o' blood but dust know wot 'er mother said?
'Er said: 'It'll do 'er good! 'Er could do with some o' that mad blood lettin' ite on 'er.
But 'er was a grand lass fer aw that.
Ar reckon that bloke wot wrote that hymn 'O day of rest an' gladness' adna 'eerd abite theyse local preychers trampin' up an' dine th'country, it wonna exactly a rest-dee for them.
Tak owd Daniel fer instance.
Ey musta preyched fer nigh on 50 yeer.
Ar con remember one Sundee mornin' when ey eksed me if ar'd larke go with 'im ter a little chapel off Crewe road.
Ar'd bey in me early twenties at th'tarme.
Wey'd just come ite o' Sundee Schoo' an' ey was goin' tak th'Harvest Festival services at this chapel.
It was a nice dee at th'back-end o' September so ar said: 'Awreyght, ar'll go with thee fer company. Wot tarms are we startin' off?'
Ey said wey were goin' nar - straight awee.
Ey reckoned it'd tak us th'best part o two 'ours fer get theer, an' ey'd bin invited ter a farm-'ice fer 'is dinner an' tey.
So we struck off.
Ar soon funt ite as owd Daniel 'adna much use fer roads an' paths unless thee 'appened fer bey on th'crowline.
If thee wonna, ey just cut straight across th'feylds.
It 'ad bin a leete harvest an' there were a lot o' corn still weetin' fer bey carted.
Owd Daniel lukked at it an'said: 'There's one hymn wey shanna bey 'avin' terdee.
Wey conna sing 'All is safely gathered in' withite tellin' lies, con we?
Wey got ter this farm abite one o'clock.
Ar've never seyn ser much stuff on a dinner-teeble eether befoer or since.
Ther was enough fer feyd an army!
Ar was that famished ar 'ad me kneyfe an' foke at th'ready afoer owd Daniel 'ad finished th'grace.
Ar didna 'ear much o' 'is sermon in th'afternoon - ar was full ter bostin' an' ar think ar musta dozed off.
y. Th'farmer's weyfe thowght ther was summat up with me.
Owd Daniel did it justice though, an' ey give 'em a good threy-quarters of an 'our sermon at neyght.
Dust know, ar con still remember 'is text — it was ite o' the' Owd Testament: 'Thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy fields, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest — thou shalt leave them for the poor and the stranger.'
Th'farmer would 'ave us goin' back ter th'farm fer some supper.
Theyse farmers dunna 'afe get through some snappin'!
Wey 'ad cheyse, pittled damsons an' wom-beeked bread.
It was dark be this tarme an' wey'd got a couple o' 'ours walkin' fer do.
Anyroad, th'farmer said ey'd get th'pony an' trap ite fer tak us dine th'leene as fer as th'meen road.
Ar thowght th'farmer 'ud bey comin' with us, but ey said: 'When 'ee get ter th'meen road just turn th'pony rind an' start 'im back wom - ey'll bey awreyght.'
Wey stood an' listened fer a bit ter th'pony trottin' back up th'leene an' then owd Daniel struck off across th'feylds aggen.
Th'owd feller 'ad got bey up at 5 0'clock in th'mornin' fer go dine th'pit.
Ar reckon somebody ought ter 'ave given 'im a medal.
Come fer think on it though, p'raps SOMEBODY did!
Ther were little pits an' tunnels aw ower the'opper.
Did ar ever tell thee abite them two brothers wot dug a tunnel inter th'side o' a bonk?
Th'seym o' coal wonna much moer than a foot thick, but it was a bit o' good stuff.
Theyse brothers 'ad a box on some runners with a peyce o' rope tied ter eych end.
One on 'em 'ud crawl inter th'ole with a candle, draggin' th'box after 'im.
When ey'd filled th'box with coal, ey'd give a couple o' tugs on th'rope.
Th'other brother pulled th'box ite an' emptied it, an' then signalled fer it bey pulled back aggen.
But one dee when ey pulled th'box ite ther wonna any coal in it — ther was a bird's neyst in it with foer eggs!
Ey stood theer scrattin' 'is yed an' gawpin' at this neyst.
Ey couldna understand it but ey shyted dine th'ole: 'Dust want 'em fried or poached?'
Wot dust think 'ad 'appened, sirree?
This tunnel 'ad gone straight through th'bonk an' come ite on th'other side oa a bush!
This nest was in th'bush.
So, fer a laugh, ey'd popped it in th'box an' signalled 'is brother fer pull it ite.
Tote th'end o' th'strike, aw theyse little pits 'ad fer bey filled in.
Ther was a mon comin' fer inspect 'em at 12 o'clock on th'Satdee.
Mind thee, a lot on 'em were drawin' coal 'till th'last minute.
Two on 'em 'ad a shaft abite 20 foot deyp an' thee left it too leete fer fill th'ole in.
So thee put some branches across top o' th'ole an' covered em with clods an' threw a bit o' dirt on top.
This inspector-mon were bit suspicious abite this big pile o' dirt wot thee 'adna put back.
When ey eksed 'em abite it one o' th'owd miners said: 'Dunna worry theesel' abite that lad. It's just a bit wot wey 'ad left ower. Mey an' Charlie are goin' dig another 'ole fer put it in.'`;
